# PsiOC
### Don't expect it to be maintained
A Minecraft that allows users to write PSI spell in lua using OpenComputers

I'm just dumping the code here, it's not really meant to be used. I just wrote it because i wanted to see if i could and it's not entirely done.
Most of it works, but it doesn't consume PSI, though i haven't fully tested it.

## How to use:
* Flash an OpenComputers EEPROM with some code (there are some [examples](https://github.com/djpadbit/PsiOC/tree/master/examples))
* In a crafting grid, put a spell bullet and the EEPROM
* There ya go
